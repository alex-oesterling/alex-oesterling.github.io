# Education

- BSE Electrical and Computer Engineering, BS Computer Science, _summa cum laude_, Duke University, 2022
- PhD in Computer Science, Harvard University, 2027 (expected)

# Work experience

- Research Assistant, _Guillermo Sapiro, Duke University_, January 2021 – May 2022

  - Explored backwards compatibility in machine learning models with the goal of maintaining case-by-case performance between model generations.
  - Investigated simulated generations of machine learning models to understand why updated models decrease performance on certain data points.

- Research Assistant, _Cynthia Rudin, Duke University_, January 2021 - February 2022

  - Competed in data science competition for citation context classification at NAACL 2021 conference.
    - Rotated as team strategist, leader, and member while developing NLP tools for context classification for both multiclass and binary classifcation tasks.
    - Wrote paper and presented at NAACL 2021 in the Scholarly Document Processing workshop.
  - Investigated genomics datasets from UNC Chapel Hill to find multiomic predictors for HIV in cell ines.
    - Publication of results in review.

- Research Fellow, _David R. Smith, Duke University_, May 2019 – August 2021

  - Designed and ran experiments investigating radio frequency imaging for human presence detection. Funded by the Department of Energy ARPA-E program to reduce residential power consumption by 30%.
  - Investigated machine learning approaches to data analysis to classify human behaviors such as breathing, walking, and sitting.
  - Designed and measured experimental configurations to simulate human behavior using an advanced metamaterial antenna.
  - Published paper as first author in the IEEE Access journal.

- Teaching Assistant, _Duke University First Year Design (EGR 101)_ Fall 2019 - Spring 2022

  - Led small project teams of freshman engineers to teach students the fundamentals of design, problem solving, collaboration, and project management as they create real world solutions for local clients.
    - Provided technical knowledge, managed conflicts, and mentored students throughout the project cycle.
    - Taught three years of freshmen, directly working with 20 students total and managing two classes of 50 each.
    - Interviewed TA candidates and provided hiring feedback to professors.
    - Created projects with real world impact, such as: a fever-simulating mannequin for nurses, a mirror to socialize NICU babies, and a decibel detector for workshop ear safety.

- Software Development Engineer Intern, _Amazon Alexa_, Summer 2021
  - Improved ambient Alexa experience by introducing new use case for customers owning a single device with a screen.
  - Facilitated users to send visual commands to one device without a screen and have the response come from another device with a screen.
  - Wrote software to impact over 14 million customers worldwide.

# Service

- Communication Assisting Device, _Independent Project_, January 2019 – March 2022
  - Improved a communication device for Emma, a teenager with a movement disability, to be able to engage with classmates in school.
  - Met with faculty panels for safety reviews, assembled risk assessments and failure analyses, and designed and fabricated electronics (PCBs, Arduino programming) to control device.
  - Worked for three years through the pandemic to perfect our design and ensure the safety of the device.
  - Completed and delivered the project successfully in March of 2022.
